## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this challenge assignment was to find temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

Below are my summary statistics for the temperatures in June and December:

Three main differences are:
- The minimum temperature in June was 64 versus 56 in December.
- Average temperature was lower in December as expected.
- There was a higher standard deviation from the mean in December.

## Summary

Although the temperatures in December are lower than June, I still think the weather qualifies to keep the surf and ice cream shop in business. The temperatures are not considered freezing, therefore it is still highly probably that people will still want to surf and eat ice cream.

Additional queries I would perform:
- find the summary statistics of temperature by station
- ice cream preferences on the island
